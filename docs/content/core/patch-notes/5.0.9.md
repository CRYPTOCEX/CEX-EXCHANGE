## Fixed

### WebSocket Market Data Handler System
- **Message Validation**: Enhanced message validation to prevent crashes when payload is undefined or malformed
- **Client Validation**: Improved client validation to handle "Client undefined not found" errors
- **Symbol Validation**: Better symbol validation with market loading and availability checks
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling in BaseMarketDataHandler with more descriptive error messages
- **Subscription Cleanup**: Added onClose export function to properly clean up subscriptions when clients disconnect
- **Market Validation**: Fixed "binance does not have market symbol" errors with proper market validation

### OHLCV WebSocket Real-time Streaming
- **Hybrid Real-time Approach**: Fixed OHLCV data stuck on single candle with hybrid real-time approach combining periodic candle fetching with real-time ticker updates
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses `fetchTicker` to update current incomplete candle (high, low, close) in real-time
- **Periodic Refresh**: Fetches fresh OHLCV data based on timeframe intervals (max 30 seconds)
- **Smart Caching**: Maintains candle cache with proper timestamp-based management
- **Interval Awareness**: Calculates appropriate fetch intervals (1m, 5m, 1h, etc.) for each timeframe
- **Current Candle Updates**: Live ticker price updates the current candle's high/low/close values
- **Memory Efficiency**: Proper cleanup of caches, fetch timestamps, and ticker subscriptions
- **Performance**: 1-second polling with intelligent fetch scheduling based on candle timeframes

## Enhanced

### WebSocket Architecture
- **Root Cause Resolution**: CCXT `watchOHLCV` is not truly real-time like ticker/trades - it fetches completed candles only
- **Intelligent Polling**: Smart polling system that adapts to different timeframes for optimal performance
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging for candle fetches, ticker updates, and cache operations
