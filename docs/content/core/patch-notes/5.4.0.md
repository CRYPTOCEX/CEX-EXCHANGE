  - **Flexible Validation**: Updated validation logic to filter undefined values appropriately

### **Error Message Security**
- **Withdrawal Errors**: Secured all spot withdrawal error messages to prevent information leakage
  - **Provider Abstraction**: Removed "binance", "kucoin", "xt" references from user-visible errors
  - **Generic Responses**: Implemented user-friendly error messages that don't reveal backend infrastructure

### **Security Vulnerabilities**
- **Dependency Updates**: Patched security vulnerabilities in backend dependencies
  - **IP Package**: Updated `ip` package to address security advisories
  - **XLSX Package**: Updated `xlsx` package to latest secure version
  - **PayPal SDK**: Replaced deprecated PayPal SDK with actively maintained version

## Technical Improvements
### **API Security**
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling across withdrawal endpoints to maintain provider abstraction
- **Schema Flexibility**: Improved validation schemas to support better admin user experience
- **Data Protection**: Strengthened protection of internal system details from end users

### **Build System Enhancements**
- **Webpack Configuration**: Improved build system to handle modern ES modules and complex dependencies
  - **Node.js Fallbacks**: Added fallback configuration for Node.js-specific modules (fs, path, crypto, stream, buffer) in browser builds
  - **Module Resolution**: Enhanced module resolution for third-party packages with complex dependency structures
  - **Build Warnings**: Implemented selective warning suppression for known safe module resolution patterns
  - **ES Module Support**: Improved handling of packages using modern ES module exports and lit components

### **Dependency Management**
- **Workspace Configuration**: Optimized pnpm workspace setup for better dependency resolution
  - **Centralized Overrides**: Consolidated all `pnpm.overrides` and `peerDependencyRules` to root package.json
  - **Version Consistency**: Enforced consistent dependency versions across frontend and backend workspaces
  - **Peer Dependency Resolution**: Improved handling of peer dependency conflicts for React 19 and TypeScript 5.9
  - **Security Updates**: Updated vulnerable packages including `ip`, `xlsx`, and deprecated PayPal SDK
