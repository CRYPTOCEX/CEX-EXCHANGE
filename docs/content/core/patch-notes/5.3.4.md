# Core v5.3.4
**Release Date:** January 17, 2025  
**Tags:** EXCHANGE INTEGRATION, BUG FIXES, SPOT TRADING

## Fixed

### **CRITICAL FIXES** - KuCoin Exchange Integration
- **KuCoin SPOT Deposit Address Generation**: Fixed critical issue where SPOT wallet deposit addresses were returning empty objects `{}` for KuCoin exchange
  - Root cause: KuCoin API expects network IDs (e.g., `ERC20`) directly rather than blockchain names (e.g., `eth`)
  - Enhanced network mapping system to correctly handle KuCoin's specific network ID requirements
  - Added comprehensive fallback system with multiple CCXT methods for deposit address generation
  - Implemented intelligent network validation using KuCoin's currency network structure

### **SPOT Wallet Error Handling**
- **Error Message Context Fixing**: Fixed incorrect error messages showing ECO wallet errors for SPOT wallet operations
  - SPOT deposits no longer show "All custodial wallets are currently in use" error (ECO-specific)
  - Added wallet-type-specific error handling for better user experience
  - Enhanced frontend error detection to properly differentiate between wallet types

### **Deposit Interface Improvements**
- **Wallet Type Grid Layout**: Fixed deposit form layout to display maximum 3 columns instead of 4 for wallet type selection
  - Updated grid layout from `lg:grid-cols-4` to `lg:grid-cols-3` to match available wallet types (Fiat, Spot, Eco)
  - Improved visual balance and spacing for wallet type selection interface

## Enhanced

### **Exchange Integration Reliability**
- **Multi-Method Fallback System**: Enhanced KuCoin deposit address generation with comprehensive method fallback
  - Tries multiple CCXT methods (`fetchDepositAddressesByNetwork`, `createDepositAddress`, `fetchDepositAddress`) with graceful degradation
  - Improved success rate for deposit address generation across different exchange configurations

### **Network Mapping Intelligence** 
- **Dynamic Network Detection**: Enhanced network mapping to dynamically detect available networks from exchange API
  - Automatic validation of chain names against exchange-supported networks
  - Intelligent fallback mappings for common blockchain-to-token-standard conversions
